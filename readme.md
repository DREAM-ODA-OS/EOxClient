# DREAM-Client

The DREAM-Client focuses on creating a webclient for map applications, which allows easy customization through a centralized configuration concept.

## Technologies used

The application uses [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) which integrates:

* [Yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) : scaffolds out the application, writing the Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks that you might need for your build.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) : which allows building, previewing and testing the project
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) : which allows managing of dependencies and automatic download, thus making the application easily extendable.

## Libraries used

* [require](http://requirejs.org/)
* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Backbone Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
